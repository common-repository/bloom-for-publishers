== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I geotag my Posts? =

When creating or editing a Post, scroll down the page to see a section titled "Geotag Locations." There's a button labeled "Add Location" or "Add Another" that will display a geotag form when clicked. Search for a location and confirm by selecting a location in the list of results. When you click the Save or Publish button, your Post will be geotagged with the locations you provide.

= Why do some location searches not give results? =

The location search results will return options that are specific addresses, neighborhoods, postal codes, cities, counties, or other small region. It will not return results for states, countries, or similar larger regional or national geographic area. To help clarify exactly why no results were given, a message should accompany the search result area with more information.

= How many locations can I geotag for a Post? = 

You may have 1 primary location and up to 30 secondary locations geotagged for a Post. Geotagging is optional and is only recommended for locations related to the Post's content.

= How is the location displayed in a Post? =

The location you select for a Post is not displayed on the front-end of the webpage unless if you have enabled a Map, Local Search, or other Bloom plugin. By default, the primary location is saved as metadata within the page, which means it will be accessible by other websites and tools, such as search engines and social networks.
